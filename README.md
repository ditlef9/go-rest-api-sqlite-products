## üîë Setting up a human user and service user

Open Postman, setup the following routes:

* POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/signup<br>
Body > Raw:
```
{
    "email": "human@gmail.com",
    "password": "Vinterferie2024!"
}
```

* POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/signup<br>
Body > Raw:
```
{
    "email": "service@gmail.com",
    "password": "Vinterferie2024!"
}
```

Set the new users as `approved` by opening sqlite.db in DB Browser for SQLite:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
UPDATE users SET approved=1;
```

Now login as human or service to get a authorization token:

* POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/login<br>
  Body > Raw:
```
{
    "email": "human@gmail.com",
    "password": "Vinterferie2024!"
}
```

Next you can use the different routes with the authorization token:

* GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products<br>
  Headers:
  - Authorization TOKEN
